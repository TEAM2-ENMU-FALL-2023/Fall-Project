Daniel Sanchez. (Jobs done.)

For Stage 2 of the Project, I helped implement UML design, in Lucid Chart. I also encouraged the facilitation of our group meetings, in Microsoft Meetings, keeping the Project on course for due date. I also utilized Microsoft Meetings to use Lucid Charts live link feature, further increasing our efficiency as a team. I also reached out to the Professor for clarification on design to aide quality of work.
